# Data-Science

There are two types of Projects.
One is relate to Classification.
Other one is related to Regression.

Loan Prediction is Classification based which predicts whether we get a loan or not.
Price Finder is Regression based which predicts the price of the car.

Some Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Trees,Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression,Linear Regression were used to test the performance of the model that is built.

There are some other measures such as Classification Report,R-Score,Confusion Matrix were used.

Data Cleaning, Data Transformation were performed at the initial stages so that the data gets into the task relevant form.
Model performance depends upon on how accurate our data is.
